# Power-BI Road accident analysis project
This project provides an in-depth analysis of road accidents using Power BI. It helps identify key patterns, accident-prone areas, contributing factors, and trends over time. The insights from this dashboard can assist in making data-driven decisions to improve road safet
  
# Objectives
Analyze road accident trends and casualty data to identify patterns.

Visualize accident hotspots using geospatial mapping.

Categorize accidents based on vehicle type, road type, and weather conditions.

Provide insights into urban vs. rural accident distributions.

Assist policymakers in making data-driven decisions to improve road safety
